# Project 3: Spots

An image sharing site.

## Description
This project is intended to build on previous skills learned and introduce figma.  
 
We learned how to import images from Figma and how to look at the details of all the elements.
Also, we implemented media queries in order to understand how to build a responsive website and show correctly on various screen sizes.

## Tech Stack

-HTML
-CSS
-Responsive Design

## Improvement goals

I intend on practicing more and hope to be able to get to the point where I can build the project without refering to the video.
